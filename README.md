# Markdown Previewer
The Markdown Previewer is a web application that allows you to write and preview Markdown in real-time. Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text, commonly used for writing documentation, blog posts, and README files.


## Features
* Live Markdown preview: As you type in the editor, the app updates the preview in real-time, showing you how your Markdown will be rendered as HTML.
* GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) support: The previewer supports GitHub Flavored Markdown, which includes syntax for tables, task lists, and more.
* Default content: When the app loads, it displays a default set of Markdown content showcasing various Markdown elements like headings, links, code blocks, lists, images, and more.
* Error handling: The app gracefully handles parsing errors and displays a user-friendly error message if the entered Markdown has syntax issues.
